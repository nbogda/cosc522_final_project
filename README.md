Repository for the final project in COSC 522
============================================

##Contributors: Natalie Bogda, Tuhin Subhra Das, and Charles Rizzo

Project Goal
===============

* Create as good of a model as possible to predict monthly online sales of a product. 
   - Data and goals taken from [this Kaggle competition from 2012](https://www.kaggle.com/c/online-sales/)


Methods
============

##We will be experimenting with the following methods

###Data Preprocessing
* Data normalization
* Dimensionality reduction (FLD, PCA)

###Classification, both supervised and unsupervised
* Maximum Posterior Probability (Case 1, 2, and 3)
* kNN 
* Neural Network with backpropagation
* Decision trees
* SVMs
* Clustering (kmeans, WTA, kohonen, or mean shift)

###Ensemble techniques
* Classifier fusion

###Evaluation
* k-fold cross validation
* confusion matrix
* ROC curve, F1 score
